  <description>
    The first state in the pac-man-bot statemachine.
    This behavior will control two 
    things. First, it will control the switch waiting
    period. This state will initialize on startup, and
    wait for the start switch to be pressed. Secondly,
    it will wait 30 seconds during the communication
    phase. After both of these are completed, it will
    release control.
